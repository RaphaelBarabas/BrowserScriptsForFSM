# BrowserScriptsForFSM

Use a Browser Extension to have these executed when you load certain web pages. 
Each script is configured to only act on specific URLs. It will tap in and inject page elements.

There's many Extensions to do this, look for a [Userscript Manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript_manager) to find your favorite.

To name a few:
* Greasemonkey - The original evolved to this
* Violentmonkey - I use this for MS Edge
* Tampermonkey - Seems to have a large user base
* Firemonkey - If you prefer FireFox

For SAP Employees: ISE comes with a Userscript Manager already. Copy it to *%APPDATA%/ISE/scripts/dev/* (create the dev folder).
